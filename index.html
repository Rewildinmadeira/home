    <h2>The Location</h2>
    <p>
      Casa do Lanço – Verdelho is nestled in the heart of São Vicente, surrounded by the lush expanse of a 25,000m² vineyard, framed by towering mountains and the dense, ancient Laurissilva forest. This UNESCO World Heritage site, with its twisting laurel trees, ferns, and moss-covered rocks, feels like a living, breathing landscape that has remained untouched for centuries. A 250-year-old oak stands at the center of it all, offering its steady presence to the land. The house itself blends the rustic charm of the past with modern comforts, each room leading out to a peaceful garden.

    <h2>About Madeira</h2>
    <p>
      Just 1.5 hours by plane from Lisbon, Madeira is a quick trip that feels like a true escape. Known for its soaring cliffs, lush green landscapes, and warm, welcoming culture, it’s a place where adventure and peace exist in perfect balance. Often called the "Pearl of the Atlantic," Madeira is the kind of destination where you can hike to a waterfall in the morning, savor fresh seafood by the sea in the afternoon, and still have time to watch the sunset above the clouds. It’s accessible yet remote enough to feel like a secret place where you come to disconnect from the rush of daily life and reconnect with yourself.

            <h3>Nature Adventures</h3>
            <p>
              A visit to Madeira is incomplete without a deep-dive into the rich wilderness this island has to offer.
              During the retreat, you will be hiking, canyoning and exploring your senses with daily nature rituals.

            <p>
              You don’t just have a body, you are a body.
              All of life is experienced through the body, which is why you will be diving into guided somatic practices that allow the changes you want to see in your life to be felt and last.

              With hands-on activities, we hope to inspire you to dive into sustainable traditions in your own communities.

          <h3>Maša</h3>
          <p>
            Maša lives and breathes all things movement, sleep, and dreams.
          </p>
          <p>
            In what seems like a past life, she was an interpreter and translator glued to her office job, with an unexpressed desire to move and be more connected with nature and people around her. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Once that desire surfaced, she spent 5 years diving into different certifications of Hatha Yoga, AcroYoga, Embodied Facilitation, Sleep Therapy, and different movement practices. At the tail end of that, she left the career that no longer lit her up to fully pursue the passions that were driving her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, she helps people create sustainable routines and rituals that allow them to sleep better, move more fluidly, and lead a life that is fully aligned with their core values.

              The dream practices that will be introduced by Maša are an invitation to explore your unconscious patterns through your dreams. You will be guided with journaling prompts and bedtime practices that help you enhance your dream recall and vividness.

              Bring a headlamp if you own one, a rain jacket and hiking shoes that have a good grip. Bring a bathing suit as the weather might allow for a swim, and a journal for the habit-building and dream practices that you will be invited into.

              No, most of the meals you will be eating at the venue are vegan, but you will have the opportunity for other types of meals in the several traditional restaurants we will visit during the retreat.
